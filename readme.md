# Varzesh3 News Link & Image Extractor (Unified Script Version)
This project is a Python-based scraper that extracts non-video news article links from the Varzesh3 homepage and downloads the main news images from each article. It's a unified version that runs both steps in one sequence using BeautifulSoup and requests.
# What It Does?
### Step1 : Link Scraping 

- Visits the homepage of Varzesh3

- Locates news blocks (div.widget.news)

- Extracts all `<a>` tags that do not link to videos

- Saves the result in links.txt

### Step2 : Image Downloading

- Reads all news links from links.txt

- Visits each news article

- Extracts the main image inside the .news-main-image block

- Downloads and saves the image in the imagess/ directory
# installation

# Code Overview

üîó Part 1: Scrape Links

```python
web = requests.get("https://www.varzesh3.com")
soup = BeautifulSoup(web.content)
dvs = soup.find_all("div", {"class":"widget news"})
links = dvs[1].find_all("a") + dvs[2].find_all("a")
```
Filters out any links that contain video.varzesh3.com

Writes valid links to links.txt

 üîóPart 2: Download Main Images

```python
f1 = open("links.txt", "rt", encoding="utf-8")
...
img = soup.find_all("div", {"class":"news-main-image"})[0].find_all("img")[0]["src"]
```
For each link, finds the primary news image

Downloads and saves it using the image filename from URL
